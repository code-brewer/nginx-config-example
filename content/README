Complete sites served by NginX, except for paths that are served from
/etc/nginx/root/ such as /favicon.ico, /proxyerror/, /robots.txt, etc.

The "default" site is served when nothing else matches, such as when
receiving requests without a Host header or that mention our server IPs.
We make requests from ELBs to /healthcheck/ that relies on this.
